  <title>Absolute vs Relative Path in HTML</title>

<body>

  <!-- 
    📘 CONCEPT OVERVIEW:
    In HTML, when you link to images, CSS, JS, or other pages,
    you use a "path" to tell the browser *where* the file is located.

    There are two main types of paths:
      1️⃣ Absolute Path
      2️⃣ Relative Path
  -->


  <!-- ========================================================== -->
  <!-- 🟢 1️⃣ ABSOLUTE PATH -->
  <!-- ========================================================== -->

  <!-- 
    ➤ An Absolute Path gives the *full URL* (complete address)
      to reach the file — including protocol (http/https), domain name,
      and file location.

    ➤ It works from *anywhere* (because it’s a full web address).

    ➤ Example Use Case:
      When you want to load an image, video, or file 
      that is hosted on another website or server.
  -->

  <h2>Example of Absolute Path</h2>
  <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_chania.jpg" 
       alt="Beautiful Landscape" width="300">
  <!-- 
    Here, the image is loaded from the full web URL.
    Even if you move this HTML file anywhere, this image will still load
    because the path is absolute (fixed on the internet).
  -->


  <!-- ========================================================== -->
  <!-- 🟡 2️⃣ RELATIVE PATH -->
  <!-- ========================================================== -->

  <!-- 
    ➤ A Relative Path gives the *location of the file*
      relative (in relation) to the current HTML file’s folder.

    ➤ It does NOT include the full domain or protocol.

    ➤ Example Use Case:
      When you are linking to files *within your own project folder*.

    ➤ It makes your website *portable* (works on any computer or server
      as long as the folder structure is same).
  -->

  <h2>Example of Relative Path</h2>
  <!-- Suppose your project structure is:
        📂 my_website/
        ├── index.html
        └── images/
            └── photo.jpg
  -->

  <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="Local Project Image" width="300">
  <!-- 
    Here, the browser looks for 'photo.jpg' inside the 'images' folder
    which is in the same directory as this HTML file.
  -->


  <!-- ========================================================== -->
  <!-- 🔵 3️⃣ WHEN TO USE WHAT -->
  <!-- ========================================================== -->

  <!-- 
    ✅ Use ABSOLUTE PATH when:
       - The file or image is hosted on another website.
       - You need to link to external resources (CDNs, APIs, etc.).
       Example: External image, YouTube video, or Google Fonts.

    ✅ Use RELATIVE PATH when:
       - The file is stored within your own project folder.
       - You are working offline or on a local server.
       - You want your site to work after uploading it anywhere
         (no fixed internet address dependency).
  -->


  <!-- ========================================================== -->
  <!-- 🔴 4️⃣ EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT RELATIVE PATHS -->
  <!-- ========================================================== -->

  <!-- 
    ➤ Same Folder: 
      <img src="photo.jpg">
      → File is in the same folder as the HTML file.

    ➤ Inside Subfolder:
      <img src="images/photo.jpg">
      → File is inside 'images' folder.

    ➤ Go Up One Folder:
      <img src="../photo.jpg">
      → "../" means go up one level.

    ➤ Go Up Multiple Folders:
      <img src="../../assets/photo.jpg">
      → Go up two folders and then into 'assets' folder.
  -->


  <!-- ========================================================== -->
  <!-- 🧠 QUICK SUMMARY -->
  <!-- ========================================================== -->
  <!-- 
    ➤ Absolute Path = Full Internet Address (starts with http:// or https://)
    ➤ Relative Path = Local Folder Address (based on your file structure)
    ➤ Relative is best for your own website development.
    ➤ Absolute is best for linking to external sources.
